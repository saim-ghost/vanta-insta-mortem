Jarvis Platform Planning and Conversation Log
===========================================

1. User Vision:
   - Personal Jarvis platform for analyzing videos (YouTube, Instagram, etc.) and images.
   - Paste video/image links or upload files, then analyze with AI.
   - Full post-mortem: transcription, topics, concepts, timestamps, visual elements, design, fonts, colors, etc.
   - Chat-like interface, multiple videos/images per chat, menu of insights after analysis.
   - Persistent memory: saves all chats, analyses, and insights, remembers everything across sessions.
   - Local storage (SQLite or similar) for privacy and speed.

2. Features Discussed:
   - ChatGPT-style chat interface with sidebar for saved conversations.
   - Analyze button for media processing.
   - Menu of insights after analysis (transcription, topics, concepts, timestamps, visual elements, quotes, statistics, examples, definitions, controversial points, expert opinions, structure, actionable takeaways, tools/resources, related topics, follow-up questions, personal relevance, comparative analysis, etc.).
   - Multiple videos/images per chat session, one analysis at a time.
   - Automatic memory management (no manual save/load needed).
   - Proactive suggestions and connections to previous content.
   - Image analysis: OCR, color palette, font identification, design analysis, visual elements, brand analysis, technical details, aesthetic analysis, accessibility, similar images, style matching, and more.

3. Technical Stack:
   - Frontend: React.js + TypeScript (to be built after backend)
   - Backend: Python (FastAPI)
   - Database: SQLite
   - AI/Media Processing: Python libraries (Whisper, Tesseract, OpenCV, etc.)

4. Development Plan:
   - Step-by-step, modular approach: backend foundation, AI integration, persistent memory, API endpoints, then UI/UX.
   - After each step, user will confirm before proceeding.

5. Python Installation Troubleshooting:
   - User was guided to download and install Python from python.org.
   - Key options: Add Python to PATH (must check), Install launcher for all users (optional but recommended), Advanced options (safe to check all, debugging symbols/binaries optional).
   - Disk space: 200â€“500 MB depending on options.
   - Issue: Python not recognized in terminal due to PATH not updating in open sessions.
   - Solution: Close and reopen Cursor, open new terminal, verify Python with 'python --version', then proceed with backend setup.
